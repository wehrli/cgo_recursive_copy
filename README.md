# cgo_recursive_copy

The objective of this mini-project is to utilize both Go and C languages to replicate a directory into another while appending logs to a text file to capture errors and process-related information. This exercise hones the ability to implement asynchronous actions, as exemplified by the logger. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to integrate a C script seamlessly within a Go program.

Other information about the architecture and the possible improvements are in the document `CGO_Recursive_copy.pdf`
# Requirements
